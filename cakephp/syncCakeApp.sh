# Scipt to synchronize a cakephp application FROM a remote host using rsync and ssh.
# You have to specify the remote host and the current working directory will be synced.
# Optionally, you can specify the folders to sync. If no folders are specified, 
# then the default ones for cakephp will be chosen automatically (except the config folder).
